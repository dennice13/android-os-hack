Exercise 7. Call the system call and check results.
- We check the results by successfully compilation on Linux and Android tablet.

Exercise 8. Read hw2.c. What will happen if we print the return of each system call using printf right after each system call? Why?
- the falut inject won't run as expected. When we call printf, the code triggers another system call, which will return 1 because the system call made by `printf` is successful.
Therefore, even if previous system call failed, the success of 'printf' system call will override it.

Exercise 9. Read inject.h. If you did not add the system call as the last system call, what may happen?
- syscall(_NR_inject_failture) will fail to handle
